I am thrilled to announce that our team CS_Tu won the 2023 nuPlan Challenge! 
It was an amazing journey to team up with Daniel Dauner and Kashyap Chitta.
I will be at the upcoming CVPR Workshop on End-to-End Autonomous Driving to present our work. I am excited to find out more about other teamsâ€˜ ideas and findings. If you're attending CVPR, I would be happy to meet you in person and discuss our experiences!
