Autonomous driving is a rapidly evolving field that has the potential to transform transportation. Multimodal prediction and planning are crucial for enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate complex traffic scenarios safely and efficiently. In this talk an overview of recent advances in multimodal prediction and planning for autonomous driving is given.

Moreover, some of the key challenges, such as modeling interactions, planning in interactive scenarios and providing safety guarantees will be discussed.

Finally, a method for robust trajectory prediction that focuses on the needs of a downstream planner, particularly in rare but realistic scenarios is presented.
