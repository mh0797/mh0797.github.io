excerpt: 'Predicting the future motion of observed vehicles is a crucial en- abler for safe autonomous driving. The field of motion prediction has seen large progress recently with State-of-the-Art (SotA) models achieving impressive re- sults on large-scale public benchmarks. However, recent work revealed that learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be solved, by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that leverages a Frenet representation of the scene and that can be applied to SotA models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a comprehensive benchmark us- ing two SotA motion prediction models. Our experiments show that this reduces the off-road rate on challenging scenarios by more than 90%, without sacrificing average performance.'
